# Overview
After logging in for the first time, the user will be directed to the Overview page. If the user has not created any stablecoins yet, they will see a specific screen. Here, they can initiate the creation of their first stablecoin by selecting the **Create New Stablecoin** button.

If the user has already created stablecoins, they will be displayed on the dashboard. Each stablecoin will show its current status (active, paused, or frozen), along with details like the current supply. Additionally, there will be a **Manage** button that takes the user to the Operations tab for that stablecoin.
