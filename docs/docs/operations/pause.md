# Pause System

If the user chooses to pause their system, all operations related to their stablecoin, such as minting, burning, and transferring, will be halted until the user decides to resume them.
To do so, the user will click on the checkbox confirming their awareness of the action's circumstances, and then they will click the pause button.
Once the action is successfully completed, the user will be shown the resume button instead, allowing them to resume the system whenever they want.
