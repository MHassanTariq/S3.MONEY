# What is stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a type of digital currency designed to maintain a consistent value by pegging it to an external asset, such as a fiat currency like the US Dollar or a commodity such as gold. This enables stablecoins to combine the programmable features and ease of transferability of cryptocurrencies with the price stability typically associated with traditional currencies.
