## DEPLOYED_TABLE: s3m-contracts-dev

This maps (deployer-address, package-name) to contract deployment data
-- status, deployment date, ticker name, path to the contract's zip

* Partition key: *address*
* Sort key: *package_name*

## ROLES_TABLE: s3m-roles-dev

This maps (address-package, package-role) to wallet addresses who have
a given role in the contract.  The *address-package* is in the format
`deployer-address::package-name` from the `DEPLOYED_TABLE`, and the
role is one of `[burn, mint, cashIn, freeze, pause]`.

* Partition key: *address_package*
* Sort key: *package_role*

### ROLES_INDEX: s3m-roles-by-address-index-dev

This is a global index on `ROLES_TABLE` on (wallet-address,
address-package).  This is used to find packages that a wallet address
has some kind of role in.

* Partition key: *role_address*
* Sort key: *address_package*

## ADDRESS_EVENTS_TABLE: s3m-address-events-dev

This maps (wallet-address, timestamp) to a list of events that
occurred mentioning that wallet address at a certain timestamp.

* Primary key: *address*
* Sort key: *event_timestamp*

## CONTRACT_EVENTS_TABLE: s3m-contracts-events-dev

This maps (address-package, timestamp) to a list of events were
generated by a package at a certain timestamp.

* Primary key: *address_package*
* Sort key: *event_timestamp*

## BALANCES_TABLE: s3m-balances-dev

This maps (wallet-address, ticker) to their token balance for that

* Primary key: *address*
* Sort key: *ticker*

## LASTFETCH_TABLE: s3m-contracts-lastfetch-dev

This maps pakage-address to the last time we received events for that package.

* Primary key: *address_package*

## ALLOCATION_TABLE: s3m-allocation-dev

This maps (package-address, allocation-type) to the amount allocated
or minted (= unallocated) for that package, with a timestamp.

* Primary key: *address_package*
* Sort key: *allocation_type* (one of `[allocated, unallocated]`)
n
## RELATED_TABLE: s3m-related-dev

This maps (package-address, package-role) to a related role address.

* Primary key: *address_package*
* Sort key: *package_role*
